      <h1>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h1>
      <div class="green_history">
        <p>
          It was in mid-summer of 1994 when the parents of the unfortunate students, who were considered as excess
          population
          of the CSCST-AIFC Argao Campus, joined efforts to refer to the local government and pleaded for an opening
          of
          a
          high
          school in the town proper. During that time, the school (CSCST-AIFC) was limiting their population. After
          thorough
          deliberation of the students' interests and welfare, the Municipal Mayor Daniel Sesaldo and Sangguniang
          Bayan
          (SB)
          members decided to have a high school, which is an extension of the Colawin National High School, Colawin,
          Argao,
          Cebu.
          <br>
          <br>
          Many constituents were delighted to have an extension school located in the heart of the town. However, when
          the
          school year (SY) 1994-1995 was about to begin, other problems arose: (1) hiring of teachers, (2) where
          classes
          were
          to be held, and (3) textbooks, chairs, and chalkboards. Despite the odds, everyone concerned was guided by
          the
          belief that "God provides."
          <br>
          <br>
          On June 6, 1994, Mrs. Nigelita A. Relacion brought the 114 students from CSCST-AIFC to the Argao
          mini-coliseum
          opposite of the said school and had these students sit on a stairway, with their parents sitting opposite
          them,
          saddened by the situation.
          <br>
          <br>
          With this situation, three teachers voluntarily and humbly accepted the challenge of educating the young
          minds,
          namely Mrs. Nigelita A Relacion, Mr. Bebiano C. Barrios, and Miss Luisita O. Carreon. In return, they
          received
          an
          honorarium from the local government of P3,101.00 per month. Having teaching as their vocation, they
          dedicated
          themselves to the challenging world in the Argao mini-coliseum where classes were held. Some students were
          sitting
          on a stairway up to the stage, while others brought stools to and from the so-called school-coliseum.
          Despite
          criticisms that came their way, the students were teased with the name of the school as "UC" - the
          University
          of
          Coliseum. Such an acronym made them tougher and determined to double their efforts to outwit those who
          criticized
          them.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thus, the pioneer batch of "Argao National High School-Colawin Extension" was blessed with a new and
          spacious
          school
          site in Barangay Canbanua. The first enrollment of 165 students grew to 1,200 students in their fourth year
          of
          operation. The limited benches and arm-chairs are now in a one-to-one ratio. The teaching force of three
          became
          six
          with the addition of Mr. Javeriano A. Egos, Mrs. Ma. Cleofe M. Saniel, and Mrs. Junnah P. Teo, and later
          became
          twenty-six.
          <br>
          <br>
          The student population has reached nemorous amounts, and the teaching force has grown. The
          faculty
          members
          and the students enjoy their stay in the new site, away from nuisances and other pollutants. With this,
          quality
          education can be met.
        </p>

      <div class="history_image">
        <p>Over the years, Argao National High School (ANHS) continued to thrive and expand, becoming a prominent
          educational institution in the region. Under the dedicated leadership of its principals and the support of the
          local government and the Department of Education, ANHS consistently strived for excellence in academics and
          co-curricular activities.
          <br>
          <br>

          With the growth in student population and faculty members, the school introduced various academic and
          extracurricular programs to cater to the diverse interests and talents of its students. ANHS established clubs
          and organizations, including the student council, which allowed students to develop their skills and passions
          outside the classroom.
